# Gomoku
Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a two-player abstract strategy board game where players alternate placing black and white stones on a 15x15 grid (or other sizes), aiming to be the first to form an unbroken line of exactly five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

Running the python file will begin a 2 player Gomoku game in the terminal, where players must input the coordinates at which they would like to place their counters in the same format as one would for chess (A1 for the top left corner for example).
